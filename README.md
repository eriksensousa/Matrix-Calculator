<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3> 

A matrix calculator is a tool that can perform various calculations on matrices, such as matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion. 

In this project, we will explore how to create a matrix calculator using the Python programming language without the use of any modules. 

Built to perform various operations on matrices that users input. It can add matrices, multiply a matrix by a scalar, multiply matrices, perform various transpositions on a matrix, calculate a determinant, and find the inverse of a matrix. 

Although it would practically make more sense to use numpy to work with matrices, it was fun to build a matrix calculator in pure Python.

<h3> BACKGROUND </h3>

Python provides several libraries for performing matrix calculations, including NumPy, which is a powerful library for working with arrays and matrices. NumPy provides a wide range of functions for performing matrix calculations, and it also implements operations between arrays and matrices efficiently.

<h3> METHODOLOGY </h3> 

To create a matrix calculator in Python using NumPy, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, such as the NumPy library.
2. Create arrays to represent your matrices using the array function from the NumPy library.
3. Use the various functions provided by NumPy to perform matrix calculations, such as matmul for matrix multiplication and transpose for transposition.
4. Implement a user interface to allow users to input matrices and select the desired calculation.

<h3> RESULTS </h3>

By following these steps, you will be able to create a fully functional matrix calculator using Python and the NumPy library. You can use this project to learn more about arrays and matrices, as well as how to perform calculations on them using Python.

A Matrix Calculator in Python can be created using the NumPy library, which provides a wide range of functions for performing matrix calculations.

NumPy is a powerful library that allows you to create and manipulate arrays and matrices, and it also implements operations between them efficiently.

To create a matrix calculator in Python using NumPy, you can start by importing the NumPy library and creating arrays to represent your matrices.

You can then use the various functions provided by NumPy to perform matrix calculations, such as matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion.

For example, here is some sample code that shows how to create two matrices and multiply them using the *matmul* function from the NumPy library:

>
> import numpy as np
>
> #Create two matrices
>
> A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
>
>  B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
>
> #Multiply the matrices
>
> C = np.matmul(A, B)
>
> #Print the result
>
> print(C)
>

This code creates two 2x2 matrices A and B, multiplies them using the matmul function from the NumPy library, and prints the result. You can use similar code to perform other matrix calculations using the functions provided by NumPy.

Conclusion: In conclusion, creating a matrix calculator using Python is an interesting and challenging project that can help you improve your programming skills. By using the NumPy library and following the steps outlined above, you can easily create a working matrix calculator in Python.
